[ info ]

1.21/1.21.1 cheat made for anarchy and ghost servers. Tries to do both but fails. Looks like shit aswell.
Somehow despite spending 6 or so years on making Minecraft garbage, the developers still can't code something that's actually good.
Config loading and saving using codes is broken.

[ how-to ]

Install Fabric for either 1.21 or 1.21.1 Minecraft.
Download the crack from https://crystalpvp.ru/boze/finalboze.zip (or this repo) and put EVERYTHING into your .minecraft/mods folder.
Start the game.

[ farewell thoughts ]
If you want to learn how to crack Minecraft cheats or "make your own PlutoSolutions", stop and think again.

To do that you need to learn how the JVM and the Java bytecode work. This knowledge is useless outside of Minecraft and it will not help you in finding a job, because there are no jobs that require knowledge of that.

You will regret wasting your time on this shit, even if you are going to "do this just for fun" like we did.

basically instead of cracking minecraft cheats learn c++/asm/windows kernel and make & sell a cheat for fortnite/rust/pubg/apex, atleast then youll make some big bank and learn things that will be able to benefit you in the future
